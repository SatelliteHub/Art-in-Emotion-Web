                <p>Micä "Life in the city" Born in Brittany in 1969, Micä has painted since his earliest childhood.
                    Internationally renowned, Micä has developed a unique style.</p>
                <p>As a student, he is driving a 1957 Chevrolet that crosses the United States from east to west. He
                    photographs, draws and paints the simple moments of everyday life. For Micä the city is a landscape
                    of movement and color. Micä makes us feel animated moments bubbling with life, the very essence of
                    city life bursts out under his brushes. With a free and generous gesture, he creates contemporary
                    paintings vibrant with light of rare dynamism.</p>
                <p>"Life in the City" by Micä… an emblematic title which sums up so well dynamic paintings young and
                    bursting with life. Japanese and Americans were the first to collect Micä's paintings. Many
                    collectors around the world in Europe, the United States and Japan have been seduced
                    by the exceptional vitality of his Art.</p>
                <p>Micä offers us two new collections of a more classic tone, one of the streets of San Francisco and
                    their vertiginous perspective, the other “Eye's bird vision” and its landscapes of France seen from
                    above.</p>
