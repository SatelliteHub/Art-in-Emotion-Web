                <p>A worthy heir to the best portraitists of Dutch painting from the 17th century, the “Golden Century,”
                    Van Belle continues this great pictorial tradition. Powerfully realistic, his female portraits
                    emerge from abstract and colorful backgrounds, serving as both a perfect contrast and an essential
                    complement, which gives Van Belle's contemporary painting
                    great modernity.</p>
                <p>Of vibrant beauty and created with the long patience of a technique akin to that of Dutch painters
                    from the Golden Age—demanding and perfectly controlled—Van Belle’s “women” always possess a
                    benevolent and captivating gaze that transports and moves us deep within ourselves.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of Van Belle’s work is its ability to reveal the deepest part of
                    the soul of its subjects, simply… with a look! This is the talent of a great artist: Van Belle.
