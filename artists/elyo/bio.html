                <p>Elyo has loved gardening since childhood. The tranquility, slowness, and serenity of his garden
                    inspired him to create this collection. He observes the birds and their habits according to the
                    seasons, such as the robins that can become attached to you and visit daily, the wilder goldfinches,
                    and many other species. Elyo created a series on our familiar birds, featuring close-ups with great
                    precision of line, resulting in colorful and joyful canvases for contemporary interiors.
